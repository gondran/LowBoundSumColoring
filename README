We reuse the code source 'MoMC2016.c' from Chu-Min Li & Hua Jiang (see copyright in the file)
This is a software for finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph.

Compile for obtaining SoMC, DoMC and MoMC, respectively, from the same source:

gcc MoMC2016.c -O3 -DSOMC -o SoMC
gcc MoMC2016.c -O3 -DDOMC -o DoMC
gcc MoMC2016.c -O3 -DMOMC -o MoMC

for finding a maximum clique, run 
./MoMC inputGraphInDimacsFormat

for listing all maximum cliques
./MoMC instance -a n (where n is the max number of cliques to be printed, 
                      n must be < MAX_NB_CLQ_PRINT 3000; 1000 in the initial version)

after you can run the script python 3:

python lbSumCol.py <graph instance> <max seconds for MoMC> <lower bound of chromatic number>
exemple : python lbSumCol.py dimacs/DSJC1000.9.col 100 216

The <lower bound of chromatic number> can be equal to 0 if you have not idea of its value

It create 2 folders in the directory : 

1) "tmp" and 2 files inside:
     a) DSJC1000.9_c.col    : the complement graph of DSJC1000.9.col
     b) DSJC1000.9_is_c.col : the complement graph of all maximum cliques (independent sets) of DSJC1000.9_c.col (DSJC1000.9.col)
                             called "maximum independent set graph" in our paper
2) "results" and 3 files inside:
     a) DSJC1000.9_c_one.txt     : the ouput of ./MoMC DSJC1000.9_c.col
     b) DSJC1000.9_c_all.txt     : the ouput of ./MoMC DSJC1000.9_c.col -a 3000
     c) DSJC1000.9_is_c_one.txt  : the ouput of ./MoMC DSJC1000.9_is_c.col
